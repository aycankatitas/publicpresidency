- Looked into available hate crime data sets. It'd be interesting to correlate news/social media speech with offline activity.
  - [FBI hate crime statistics](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime), available from 1995-[2015](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2015). No more recent data available.
  - [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/12/16/update-1094-bias-related-incidents-month-following-election) (SPLC)'s curation of nation-wide hate incidents in the month following the election. No more recent data available.
  - [Slate's curation of hate incidents](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/12/hate_in_america_a_list_of_racism_bigotry_and_abuse_since_the_election.html) includes individual incidents motivated by racism, misogyny, Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia, anti-Semitism, and anti-immigrant sentiment. The list is updating.

- CAMEO ([Conflict and Mediation Event Observations](http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/CAMEO.Manual.1.1b3.pdf)) event code, which is utilized by [GDELT](https://www.gdeltproject.org/), can be helpful identifying streams of certain types of events.
