* Reviewed Empath
  * https://github.com/Ejhfast/empath-client
  * Empath has high correlation with LIWC (r = 0.8-0.9) depending on training corpus
  * Contains ~200 categories (e.g., dominant personality, government, social media, health, journalism, optimism, violence; can share list)
  * Provides word count and normalized word count per category
  * Living lexicon trained on modern text
  * Uses a VSM to determine similarity of words
  * Categories are determined by ConceptNet
  * Can use it's 200 categories (already generated and crowd sourced for validation), generate your own categories using seed terms (e.g. bleed & punch generate violence), and request Empath to validate them by crowd sourcing
* Consider hierarchical topic modeling?
