## Formal Presidential Documents

Used the [Compilation of Presidential Documents collection](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=CPD). The acquire_presdoc.R script
* Grabs metadata (document id, title, date, type)
* Grabs the plain text of the document

It needs work -- it's currently chunked up to facilitate adding a new month's documents and needs improvement and I may add additional metadata from the "more" field.
