## Cable news coverage

Used [May 2017 total viewer ratings](http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/the-top-cable-news-programs-of-may-2017/330624), the midpoint when I started collecting, to select three popular news programs from each of CNN, FOX, and MSNBC. 

* CNN: Anderson Cooper 360, Erin Burnett Outfront, The Situation Room
* MSNBC: Rachel Maddow, The Last Word/O'Donnell, All In/Hayes
* FOX: The Five, Hannity, The Story/MacCallum (begins May 1; can I get transcripts from previous version of the show -- The First 100 Days?)
* From Fox, Tucker Carlson was second, but does not provide transcripts online; Bret Baier was fourth, but can only access transcripts for the last month. Are there other source besides AccessNews?

Separate script for each news source: acquire_cnn.R, acquire_fox.R, acquire_msnbc.R. These are still very rough.
